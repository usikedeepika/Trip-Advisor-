Project Goal
The aim of this project is to create an intelligent and user-friendly travel web application that uses AI (OpenAI’s GPT) to provide personalized travel recommendations based on the user’s input and preferences. Users can discover tailored destinations, book trips securely, and share their experiences through reviews and ratings — making travel planning smarter, easier, and more interactive.

Featues
 👉 This project solves the problem of time-consuming and generic travel planning by:

Giving personalized travel suggestions based on user input (voice/text).

Helping users track past searches so they don’t need to start over.

Offering accurate and relevant results using semantic search (Apache Lucene).

Providing a space to share and explore reviews for better travel decisions.
